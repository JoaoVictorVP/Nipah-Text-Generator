"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." Charles Dickens couldn't have known about COVID-19 however The Tale of Two Titties, oops, I mean Cities certainly applies today- 12 Avril, Easter Sunday, 2020. This is the tale of how inadvertently a single, mid-life American met her favorite characters under quarantine. It is proof that ANYTHING is possible when you believe in the magical powers of love & benevolent forces of the universe.

For all the Red Sox fans, Feverpitch fans, hum along for the others who don't know "Love That Dirty Water" song... imagine the view from a drone showing the world the empty streets flying over Massachusetts General Hospital, the Healing Garden, up & over Beacon Hill, golden dome reflecting the sun of the Massachusetts State House, Boston Common, Boston Garden, over Commonwealth Avenue to Fenway Park, over Boston University East Campus, Mid-campus, over the BU bridge, over the Little League field, Morse Elementary school playground, up Pearl Street, rising over a 300 year-old heritage elm tree, hovers above a roof deck with a cabbage green French bistro set, two large white planters with popsicle stick markers watermelon, pumpkin, cucumber, two tan plastic rectangular window boxes with furnace filter wire over the top to keep the squirrels from digging up the sunflower seeds, 2 gunsmoke metal raised boxes with lavender seeds, 4 large white bags of Vermont Organic Potting soil, large galvanized vintage watering can, a loveseat made of upcycled pallet wood, a rusting snake planter upside down, a small wisteria twig with some early green buds in a white glass vase, a dead lemon tree in an old enamel basin and a turquoise hand-blown glass hummingbird feeder, just outside the apartment window, a black cat with a twitching tail looks up at the drone and makes that quivering sound that only a stalking cat can trill. The drone lowers to the window and peeks inside to capture the white iron clawed bathtub with a philodendron growing up and around the metal without a shower curtain. There's an early elementary school watercolor of half a paper kimono above the white porcelain toilet, an early elementary school watercolor with pen & ink of bugs above a field with puffy clouds and a sun peeking from one corner next to the white vanity, purple jasmine mint Marvis toothpaste tube and a bamboo toothbrush left out, black cotton yoga pants and black cotton top abandoned on the floor. A white cotton drawstring bag hangs from the back of the door with red, gray & cobalt L'Adventure Belgian lingerie hanging out. White towels, white bath mat and a blue Greek mosaic dolphin beach towel behind the tub, an enamel roasting pan with grass seed cat litter and scoop are tucked under the back of the tub...trail of litter on the black & white tile floor. The drone zooms down the hallway, past the back of the entry door with a hanging rack of variety of leather bags, including a black patent leather vintage revealing an attractive 56 year-old woman wearing a turquoise & brown large polka dot 60's 'ish dress-totally coincidence trending Beacon's closet, an eggplant purple cashmere sweater, red reading glasses, a petite silver dolphin earring in the #2 pierced left earlobe,her auburn hair up in a clip, 37 salve and white cotton rag around her neck, with heating pad plugged into the exposed outlet next to the bed. A large split leaf philodendron named Henri after Matisse, in a large black Greek urn pot atop a wire stand, is flashing two brand new bright green leaves. The bed covers are disheveled, suggesting she's had passionate wild Easter bunny jumping sex, a rechargeable purple vib is plugged into the wall on one corner of the foot of the bed. A grand, Italian antique gold mirror leaning against the wall, a pile of white cotton sheets on the other foot of the bed corner, crisp from being laundered and air dried on the roofdeck the day prior. She's sipping her favorite Creme de la Earl Grey tea, writing morning pages on college-ruled filler paper with a Lamy mechanical pencil.

"Once upon a time, at 8:15 EDT on Easter morning, 2020, I woke to the sound of my rescue 6.5 year old kitten Cleo, pawing the covers. I groggily shuffled to the kitchen in my funky, straw red house slippers, got a block of freeze-dried rabbit from the metal pantry tin marked Sugar, crumbled half of it on a small ceramic sushi sauce dish with painted cat faces, set it on the floor as Cleo head-butted and rubbed up along my shin, then crumbled the other half into a homemade plastic puzzle toy for her to play with later, peed and trundled back to bed, in just my underwear."

"When I thought I woke up for the second time that day, I must have been dreaming...because where the feather bed had been rolled & propped up on the pillow next to me, was none other than Teddy! For weeks I'd been watching "The Dressmaker" almost daily since March 3rd, as I had it from the public library on DVD. I'd been thinking a lot about Teddy, the main character in the Australian film. I want a real life Teddy, one that lives. He is so sweet, strong, family-oriented, athletic, patient, kind, handsome and lovely manners! When I first saw Mr. Liam in the film, I was struck by Aussie lightning. I'd never ever seen a Hemsworth before. I guess it's official that with my multiple concussions, as an American to not know who any of the Hems boys are...I live under a rock.

So I rolled over and laid my head on his chest, put my thigh over his and tickled his obliques softly with my manicured fingernails, just barely touching his skin. He shivered and said 'how bad', which without having graduated from Aussie English class, I interpreted as 'More please" I licked my lips and softly nibbled just under his jaw, down his neck to the end of his clavicle and then lickety-split my knickers were off and my eyes were shooting Tinkerbell Sparkles. I was hot and raring to go. I hummed, then purred and said 'Your wish is my command. Monogamous Monsieur Bond, qu'est-ce que tu veux?'

"Oo-la-la," his tongue garbled. I laughed and thought he would know how devoted I was by now. I practically knew all the lines of the entire film.

"What is it that you want? I will give you everything 110% Olympic lovemaking. I've been practicing while you've been ankle biter making with Gabriella."

He coughed, choking, chuckled and made a timeout sign. He sat up and turned to face her straight on.

"What? Don't be upset. It's not like you're cheating or anything. I mean, she doesn't know me and you don't know me and I don't really know you accept, well, I've seen enough interviews to feel like I know you, I mean maybe we were together for like a zillion previous lifetimes?" I get chatty when I'm nervous. I didn't want him to leave so soon.

"I shouldn't have told you that. Oh shit. Did I crack your shits? Oh, please, please, please. Don't be crook. Oh, you're all crickey, here, here. Let me make it, let me kiss it and make it all better," putting on my best optimistic expression. His expression however is baffled, bewildered, curious, comical, shocked, "Fuck me dead."

My face morphed to quizzical, I called a time out and said "Stay right there. Don't move, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back." I hopped out of bed, ran to my desk and thanked the universe for my pocket Aussie-English dictionary. I was madly page-turning until I found it-

"Fuck me dead"- means that surprises me." Audible escape of relief breath, I put it back, closed the drawer and sprinted back to bed, grinning 'She'll be apples.'

He laughed, rolled his eyes, looked up to the ceiling, ran his hand over his forehead then beard then trying not to crack up, he licks his lips and purses them together. Anyone who's watched even one interview with a ridiculously stupid question, has seen this signature Liam.

"Can I make it Ripper raft?" He can't help cracking up, a middle aged female American attempting to flirt in Aussie. I go to tickle him but he grabs my wrist with my wiggling fingers away from his body, "I want to stoke you." I squeal, he doesn't know my nickname in ice hockey was Weasel. I immediately swing my other hand before he can catch it as she snaps his boxer brief elastic band. "Oh, no you don't!" he declares and without a bell or referee, co-ed WWE bed wrestling is on. "I want to be your bloody Fair Dinkum in da Pool room Sheila!" He laughs harder, we wrestle some more, but I'm quick and somehow wiggle around to straddle on top of him then pressing my feet into the mattress, heaving as if pushing a 2 ton sled, with all my might to force his chest back down on to the mattress. "I want to be your Sweetabus Maximus! Your Slip, Slap, Slop!" She chants the "Not happy Jan. No Gary songs." Now he's holding his sides, he's crying, he's laughing so hard. "Oh my God, how do you know all this?" he gasps with amazement.

"Call 13 303 to," I sing "30 40 42," just for added flare.

Then I sang the Banana Boat Frog song, in the Frog voice.

"No, no, no, no. No, ahh," then I stopped and said 'that dearie, get still, serious and take a deep breath.' He stops laughing and then she grabs his hands "1/3 oo6 triple 506". And his jaw drops.

"By the way, what's the Sultana?"

Then he had one hand on each side of my face, kissed me full on, I squealed and giggled, "Can we have Chicken Tonight tomorrow because today's Easter so we should have Greek Easter lamb kebabs. Rhonda. Yes, Rhonda."

The moment was broken by my cell phone chiming, "It's time!" We both turned towards the mechanical voice and then look back at each other, in unison. "It's time"

"It's time for a quickie." I said kissing down his torso. "That's my reminder, Zoom Brain Injury Peer support call in 10 minutes. Alrighty, then it's Father's Day and then Easter," My code for bj is Father's Day, guessing that's what all Father's really want on Father's Day.

Additionally to "The Dressmaker" I had stumbled across, "Can You Keep A Secret?" on hoopla one night when none of the French films felt quite right. Again, struck by lightning by a male actor I hadn't heard of before, who as it turns out has been a famous celebrity for decades. His name is Jack, funny, sweet, intelligent, entrepreneurial, single, attentive, polite, handsome, buff and has been grief stricken...so I promptly fell in love with him too.

At some point while I was making love to Teddy, suddenly Jack appeared, and my world exploded. "Whoa! Oh my God!" I grabbed some bedcovers concealing my breasts.

"I have never imagined being in a threesome, EVER and here you two are, and oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, you are both here and it's just me with my legs up in the air imagining. Oh my God. Ah, wow! Oh my God, oh, you are here too?!...um, here I am with Teddy AND Jack....oh my sweet Tilly Emma sweet cakes...whatever am I going to do?"

I promptly excused myself to get dressed, went to the kitchen to make some tea for everyone and thought this is truly an opportune moment. Not the way you are thinking, lift your minds up from the gutters...I decided to take advantage of getting some hard core insider information. Here were two IRL Monogamous Mister Bonds...perhaps they could help; bringing in the tea tray, passing each their mug, I mentioned a few PG-13 online dating disasters and asked for advice.

"I just don't get it, I hate it when they write me, 'Why is someone like you on the internet?' I mean 'Duh! Nobody asks me for coffee or anything!' I really don't get it. Why do they say they like my profile, MY profile, but we're not a match. I mean if you like my profile wouldn't that mean that you would like me? I am ME, I wrote my profile! One guy wrote me that I am intimidating, wtf is that about?!" They chuckle and sip their tea, listening.

"Well, maybe they are thinking that lots of women don't put real things in their profiles, the pictures are old or photoshopped, things are made up, faked or outright lies." said Jack. Teddy nodded in agreement.

"Yeah, someone once told me he has 3 deal-breakers, he won't shave his beard for a woman, he'll always be a techie nerd and I forget the last one." Another time I'd asked other brain injury survivors about dating and they had all said "Internet or Apps."

"I suppose it makes sense to come up with my top three to five must-haves. Then just be ruthless, it's SO time consuming! And I'm sick of Grandpa's emailing me, I don't want to date my dad for fricks sake. It's discouraging, no it's beyond discouraging, it's, it's outright depressing! I once wrote that they should be able to run faster than me and a number of them wrote, too much arthritis...I won't be able to keep up. In other ways my cohort hasn't taken much care of themselves, they over work, have stressful co-parenting juggling, they say they want romance but how they communicate proves they need a new dictionary. Maybe I just need to give it more of a chance. Recently my aunt said, "If it's God's will, they say it will happen when you least expect it."

I looked at Teddy & Jack, "Maybe it's not going to happen this lifetime?! How the hell do I make God willing?" I mumbled, blushed, embarrassed by my dating incompetence in front of two men who have probably had lines miles/kilometers long of women throwing themselves at their feet.

"Don't take this personally Jack, but American men are just so primitive compared to the European, Middle Eastern, Scandavian or Greek men I've met. (And I suspect Aussies included) They wear ironed button-down shirts, they have more than jeans for pants, even a tie, have real non-trainer shoes, insanely intoxicating cologne, they're able to have conversations about the world, they listen, are polite and respectful. They really love the women in their lives; mothers, sisters, girlfriend, labmates, teammates. Boston is so provincial! Everyone's in such a hurry, no one looks around to enjoy a passing attractive person and that was pre-pandemic! I don't know, I suppose it would be nice to get to know someone through writing and phone calls, being long distance even if you live across the street, to find out who's true blue. But it feels like I have to look at a line-up 400 and I just don't have the cognitive reserves for that. Ok, I gotta go catch my brain injury Peer Support group. Please stay right here, don't go away."

After the Zoom call, I felt rejuvenated, connected, cared for, listened to and with all the dating conversation, I realized it's been 15 years...I DO want to find someone, someone of my very own, MY Monogamous James Bond. Not just Teddy and Jack, I watched over & over with the same lines every time...they aren't real, I want someone in the flesh. Needing a distraction from the sadness of the challenge of searching for the Holy Grail mate task, like hundreds of thousands, I went to YouTube. Once again the universe dished up high quality, I stumbled upon Nathaniel Drew, interviewing his polyglot Grandma, in Arabic, French, Italian, Hebrew, Spanish, Greek and English. They effortlessly went in and out of languages like a stunt motorcyclist weaves traffic about the L'Arc de Triomphe on Bastille Day.

The Hebrew and Arabic subtitles were lovely, she laughed delighted that she knew a little Greek, most French, some Arabic, some Italian, some Spanish, and of course English. Only at the very end did she briefly turn to face the camera, shy polyglot. I relate, don't like my picture taken, feels really exposing even with all my clothes on.

I subscribed to his channel, watched more videos including a cliffhanger, 'Stranded in Paris Alone'. Triggered flashbacks to my time in Paris, during the terrorist bombings, September 1986. A waiter had said my mother and I were "Brave Americans." Stupid Americans, foolish, ignorant women with noone watching out for us. On the 4th day of bombings, I was mortified, MORTIFIED, when my mother decided the thing to do was to go to the American Embassy and ask THEM what we should do. After an extensive security check, amongst many Marines, in full metal jacket, AK-47s, bombproof vests,et al, we finally reached the inner sanctum. Approaching a Marine maybe just one or two years older than me or perhaps exactly my age, my meek, 5'2" mother queried the gigantic, testosterone oozing Marine. " Lady, you have an American passport, if you don't like it here, go home." He succinctly informed, verbally flicking us aside, four thousand shades of red flushed through me, as I shrunk myself as small as possible to the floor and backed out onto the streets of Paris. We took the Hovercraft from Calais back to the Cliffs of Dover, then on to London cutting short our week in Paris, my graduation gift.

'"This isn't terrorism or war," as Monsieur Drew mentioned, "We have solidarity, we're all equally into this together."

Indeed, no one is invincible, we are acutely aware if willing to face it, our mortality, our humanness. The images of the Parisiens clapping on their balconies at 20:00 every evening. Maybe I will just go out at 20:00. Every night and chime my Tibetan bells for three rings and say some prayers. I'd recently learned that Mother Teresa was Albanian, that she'd gone to Rome for her religious instruction then the Albanian dictator closed the border so she couldn't return home so that's how she ended up on her mission to Calcutta.

I'd briefly seen that the USA, has had more deaths than any other country, being taken to task for not having adequate leadership, disaster bio disaster management, the CDC and health officials. No one wanted to step up and say evacuate the University's! What freaking chicken sh*ts, no freakin' balls in the face of a pandemic that swept across the globe with PLENTY of time to see it coming...like a slow moving tsunami of death. Hollywood & video games have been dishing up this for decades, so everyone seems numb & in disbelief of reality. Nobody in a position of power with the Federal government, was willing to take a shred of responsibility. The curtain is up world, now you see America for what it is, the Mighty Greedy Capitalistic Machine, chews up the poor, disabled, elderly, children, indigent, people of color, indigenous peoples and has them for breakfast, lunch & dinner. This ain't no Disneyland.

I went to Instagram to follow Nathaniel Drew there as well.

Boom! Liam in bed, black and white photo, with espresso?! 'Stay safe, stay home, stay in bed!" I messaged him happily. "Happy baby-making!" I swung my fist around hitting the bolster square in the "chest". "I just f'king Instagrammed You! Connected we're all connected! We are freely communicating! Merci universe!!! This is crazy!"

I lay between the two of them, Teddy and Jack and said "Look you each have your own Babes, ah, Ladies. I want my version of you, a no-GMO hybrid. I want my Monogamous James Bond Superhero, Extraordinary Superman, Teddy Jack. So here's the deal. The two of you are going to screen my Match.com and weed out all the riffraff and bozos because it's bloody buggered. You in? Pretend you are defiant as you advocate for a damsel in distress, like if your mom or your aunt were widowed and looking for a mate you would one hundred percent step up to make sure she found a legit 'All In' Lancelot, right?"

As I lay between them I'd turn my head to Teddy, on my right and Jack on my left, saying "Come on guys. You'll do it, right? For me, please? I promise I will be your baby Whisperer Nanny forEVER as long as you need or want. I was the eldest of 16, I have skills."

Both of them look shocked, "16!?!", they said in unison. "Yep, only my sister survived. I was pretty grief stricken as a kid, the last of 13 foster babies was adopted when I was 9yo. Here I am 56 years old, having the hottest sex of my life, it's 100% imaginary. How can imaginary love-making be so freaking hot?"

They smirked into their mugs and shrugged their shoulders in unison.

"Here's the dealio. I give you the password and you screen ,shield, deflect and eventually you let me know when there's someone, THE Someone cut of the same cloth as you, someone who will appreciate me, who will be my Indiana Jones, my Crocodile Dundee, my Paul Newman to Joanne Woodward, my Paul Novak to Mae West, my Spencer Tracy to Katharine Hepburn, my Jesus to Mary Magdalene.

"Wow, wow. Wow." Teddy & Jack say in unison.

"Isn't that what Steve Jobs said as he was dying? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Okay. Look, I'm like the Thoroughbred at the gate waiting for the bell, for it to open so I can sprint like my hair is on fire, cross the finish line ahead of everyone and then keep sprinting because I'm so happy to be able run again after too many concussions. Okay, Mr. Harper, and Mr. McSweeney, be my wingmen?" I put out my hand like the players in an old school huddle, they each slap a hand on top and once we have all hands stacked "All in" we said in unison and laughed.

I put on "Can You Keep A Secret?" playing on hoopla in the background, put on a sassy Marie Jo lAdventure knickers and brassiere from the bedroom cabinet. Went into the kitchen and made a Bondini with St. James Martinique clear rum and 100% organic cranberry juice from VT. I refilled my LifeStream water bottle, returned to the bedroom doorway, nipples at attention from the cold through the colbalt blue sheer brassiere. "I need you men to filter out the douchebags, sift through all the riffraff for the gold, my MMB!"

They both laughed, looked at each other,

"How hard can that be?"

"Sure."

"No probs."

"No worries."

"We got this."

I shook my head thinking they have no idea how many dickheads there are out there. So they will see, I went back into Match.com, reopened my profile, Easter Sunday. I was dancing to the music of the "Can You Keep A Secret" scene when they are ripping off their clothes, intense with passion. Emma's, super intimidated by Jack's rock hard abs, that he's probably had sex with lots of supermodels, models, gymnasts..." I'm with you there Emma...if Teddy or Jack gave me any time of day, I would be wondering when the other shoe would drop. That this was just a fling, that they weren't serious about anything they told me, that I was not even a notch in their belt.

Sipping my Bondini, I reactivated the match account and responded to a few. Not thrilled, but whatever.

"I'm back in the game, right? That's what matters, right?

I'm going to bawl like a little wuss now because you guys are real, Real men. I've never had a real man 100% Family Man, Hottie, committed to the Environment, philanthropy, the whole 9 yards..But just like Emma & Tilly, I deserve that 100% just like you deserve hot Babes who are 100% in your corner through thick and thin and everything in between. I want to believe it's possible for me, please. God make it possible for me, please. I don't want to be single for the rest of my life."

6:36 a.m. I wakes up, the cat wakes up. The lights are on, we all fell asleep. It was late, we all fell asleep, with the film running to the credits, hoopla star rating screen is up.

"Where's my Lamy?" I ask.

"Your what? Lambie, your baby sheep?" They rub their eyes. I searched in the covers.

"No, my German-made fantastic writing instrument."

"Your what? It's too early, it's not even 7:00 a.m."

" My pencil!" I madly pads down the covers around their bodies searching for it.

"When the Muse strikes, you jump and I mean as high as it says!"

They rub their eyes and both smile, their epic Peak physiques, shirtless, bearing witness to the gloriousness of fit masculinity.

"I fell asleep again 'To Can You Keep A Secret?' Limoncello Martinis or Bondini's, instagramming both of you until 3:00 or 4:00EDT? God knows what time it is in your zones... Am I, I have no shame, but I just wanted you to know me and how I really authentically truly am a true blue. I get you get weirdazz fan shit, I listened to Tim Ferriss'...you have to be wicked careful."

"What?" they say in unison.

"Look you boys know this. Once you get famous, there are crazies out there, stalkers, sociopaths, women whacky on estrogen, just want to get close to you."

They look at each other and say, "Yeah." nodding their heads.

"There are stalkers, sociopaths and crazies, but I'm just here, in my little Traumatic Brain Injured life, doing my little self-publishing, happy dancing, remote training roof deck planting thing. I am hoping for a service dog, can't imagine having a bodyguard. What the f- boys, I live a normal non- LA, non-Melbourne/Sydney/Outback, whatever life."

"Oh," they say together, shrugging their shoulders.

"What am I going to do? Stay home, social distancing, wash your hands for '20 seconds often', they chime in.

"No, no Tim Ferris says if you have ever ordered anything to your address, you're f'ed. I ordered furnace filters and flea meds and vitamins from CVS and resistance bands and champagne. Remember we celebrated my self publishing foi&GRÃCE?!"

"Wait, wait, calm down." Jack says.

"Never say your name when you email, use a pseudonym because they can Google you, they will Google you. Okay, like what Jesus Christ? How do you guys live like this? I've been a nobody my whole life."

"You're not a nobody," they say in unison.

"You know what I mean. Where's the 'Staying

Unstalked For Dummies' when you need it?"

They both laugh.

Wish I had that 15 years ago." Teddy says.

"Ditto" says Jack.

"Okay. I can't sleep, might as well make some tea. Want some?"

"Sure, if you're offering to get up,' Jack says.

"I need to take out my mouthguard and pee. Cleo's going to start pestering for a petit dejeuner soon. I need a big brother. I always wanted a big brother. Will you be my Big Brothers?"

They look at each other and grin.

"Okay, how about you're little big brothers. You know what I mean. I'm freaking out. Let's train!" Both men laugh, we all get up, make breakfast together and hit it. We stretched out indoors, did warm-ups, ran down the stairs and out the door. There are joggers with cobalt blue bandanas matching their Boston Strong t-shirts and sweatshirts. At the center point of the Boston University bridge, I scream "I love you Boston!" which vanishes into the wind as we briefly bask in the view from the Bridge. We jogged over the bridge, down the stairs to Storrow Drive/Charles River Boston side, outdoor gym, to have a chin-up contest. They take turns each lifting me up, so I can get in a couple assisted chin-ups. I did my job of interference between squirrels and Teddy. We did wind sprints at Magazine Beach, the seagulls and Canadian geese scoot then fly away. I showed them some goalkeeper handball drills, they smiled and laughed. I hugged the biggest heritage trees and introduced them to the Grand Dame Willow. I sat, taking a rest while Teddy and Jack took selfies and posted to social media.

Once back home, Teddy takes out a blender, making his famous smoothies. Jack takes out a dozen eggs to make an omelet, while I stood there speechless at it all. Then I set the table on the roof deck with my grandmother's 1940s table cloth, put on the kettle for tea and smiled at the shirtless gods in my kitchen. All the while I'm wearing my Boston Strong, Massachusetts General Hospital Blood Donor t-shirt and B Strong baseball cap from 2013 post-Marathon Bombings.

The next morning, I wake up on Jack's chest with Teddy spooning me.

"I want rock hard abs, two or at least a three pack" I whisper, as I start jumping two of my fingers on his belly and start singing "The wonderful thing about Tiggers, is Tiggers are wonderful things. Their tops are made out of rubber their bottoms are made out of springs" And I start to bounce back and forth between Jack's abs and Teddy's obliques, then crossing my arms, smirking, finishes the song "Tigger's are wonderful fellows.Tigger's are awfully sweet, Tigger's are something or other and that's why I repeat, repeat, Tiggers are something but the most of wonderful thing about Tiggers is, I'm the only one!" I spread my arms out across both of their chests, as they rub their eyes and laugh. "Today, boys. We jog the Charles, with wind. Supposed to be a storm today. So we train early after Petit dejeuner and as my son's Montessori directorÃ­s used to say "There is no bad weather, just inappropriate clothing."

They both raised their eyebrows and glance at each other, shrug and wink.

"Boston weather storm warning Monday, April 13th rain 100% wind gusts of 60 miles per hour. Stay away from forests and trees. No boats in the harbor." Teddy says reading the gale warning,"when the knots are that high we stay out of the water in Australia."

"Come on, boys, You afraid of a little Boston wind?"

Jack says, "Have you ever heard the term 'Blown Away'?"

Teddy says, "You're like what? 50 kilos Catz?"

"So worst case scenario, you'll both hold my hand and be my anchors."

"Your plants are amazing," Jack says.

"Don't tell anyone, I talk to them in English and French. I love them. I spray them with homemade anti-aphid potion and my son and I recently repotted them. Give them Neptune's foil formula and...um, I hesitate to tell one secret other thing."

"What?" they say in unison.

"You promise you won't freak out?" They give bewildered smirks and look at one another. I hand the tea-tray to Teddy. He puts it between the two of them.

"Okay, we're all grown-ups. I mean you" (pointing to Teddy) "had sex ed in school with your mom."

"Oh God." Jack looks at Teddy, "tell me you didn't."

"Oh, yeah mate sinceres."

"Okay," Jack says, "We're men, Superman and brother of the Gods we can handle it." He wiggles his fingers towards himself, grins, "Bring It On."

"Yes!" adds Teddy, sitting up, leaning forward.

" You're sure, 100% jeez Louise?" They nod their heads like get on with it already.

"I pour the contents of my Luna Cup in their pots."

"Oh! Nasty!" They both cringe, gag and have faces of disgust, cover their ears, moan, groan and shiver.

"Wimps! You promised you wouldn't freak!"

"I can't look at you ever again." Teddy says, Jack wipes tears from his eyes from laughing.

"Enough, enough scoot over I have to do my morning pages, planting lots and lots and lots to do boys before the weekend's over.To work, train, sew masks, baby quilt, knit baby hats, hydrate. And you're welcome. You just got a free ab work and fun ab workout, endogenous endorphins before breakfast. I focus in on my writing as they simultaneously reach over to the bedside wall shelfs, turn on their phones and start swiping.

I write 13avril 2020, day number twenty thousand, seven hundred forty-four. "I can't believe it. It's freaking awesome. I could directly messaging all three actors, tell them my strength coach was Eric Cressey, strength coach to Tim Ferriss & pro athletes. I was training alongside Major League Baseball pitchers. Made friends with later Royals pitchers Tim Collins and Chad Rogers on throwback Thursday, I dressed as '80s Madonna, was the only Sheila in the world's greatest playground, didn't tell anyone my age for fear of discrimination.

"One day I brought a bag of handballs to the gym daring Chad and Tim to shoot on me. Oh, that doesn't sound right. I made a few saves and one to my gut that made an impressive thud and they both went 'Augh!' Oh good times. That was a few months before the Dodge Hemi Ram squished my ultimate chick car, 2004 Aquarius blue VW Beetle convertible with a bronze mermaid hood ornament. Rear-ending me at about 60 miles an hour.

But let's stay positive. I'm making my come back 10 years 3 months and 13 days. Nope, plus leap day, makes 14 days. This is the happiest I've been in all of that time. Yeah, but, of course who wouldn't thrilled to be chilling with Teddy and Jack during quarantine, having Zorba/Rumi Olympic lovemaking, eating organic from Vermont, watching 'The Dressmaker' and 'Can You Keep A Secret?' every night for my bedtime stories, sleeping like a baby. No more night terrors, listening to Pandora female comedy, Zooms studying French & Peer Support, virtual fireplace in my bedroom, bathroom, anywhere in my apt., living in one of the most beautiful cities in America. Loving that dirty water Boston near my home. Hey, you guys ever see Feverpitch?" They look blank. "Feverpitch, Jack you must have seen Feverpitch! Oh my God, we're watching that over breakfast, Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Fallon Johnny Damon. The 2004 Red Sox. And yes, I was at the parade with my broom 'cause we swept the Yankees, a pink leopard spotted broom."

Over the morning the wind picked up, howled until I got into an adrenaline storm. Thinking of Nathaniel Drew's YouTube post, I started filming...

"Hey guys. I'm in the middle of, like a hurricane, well, I'm going to show you what's going on. Here's my living room, I taped up my window. There's a huge tree outside and there are branches already on the wires and we already lost a big limb that went all the way across the street earlier, but down lower there's a huge branch that is completely lined up, from this angle depending on the wind, could come completely into my window. If this window gets blown out, I'm hoping that it won't be raining a lot, water damage really sucks. So I moved all the artwork/pictures next to the bed. I haven't made my bed yet from doing the laundry yesterday. Moved Tina (the snail) into the bedroom and moved the library books to be protected from the elements. All the kids toys, clothes and stuff are in the bedroom. Put the rugs under the bed. I move the desk into the bathroom and put the futon mattress in the bathtub."I stop and put the camera focus on Cleo, my cat.

"She's been really helpful. When I was taping the window she came over and rubbed against my leg doing good support. I emptied out a lot underneath the vanity because I was madly making the bug out bag. I should bring the fabulous nail polishes for the basement, with hours with nothing to do, I can at least have sassy nails. So here's the porch, I scans with my laptop,'You can see I took down everything, the bistro table and chairs, because you know my grandmother and I used to watch the tornadoes in Wichita, Kansas, until the rest of the family would be screaming at us from the storm cellar doors to come inside. So I've got my bug-out bag, my lockbox. My valuable papers and photos. Granny's cane from Mexico, food, water, glad I've been saving a lot of water, all these bottles...Charging my cell, all the REI stuff is in the bug out bag, the hand crank flashlight, solar charger, solar panel, you can see how I may lose all my seeds if I'm thinking that huge limb, if it comes down, it's going to roll. It's going to roll down this side of the building. It may take out the top of this, downstairs roof. But maybe, just maybe all our guardian angels are looking out for us. I've got a f'king awesome load of them and all the benevolent forces of the universe and all the tree fairies. So the wind is supposed to get the highest, gusting over 65 miles an hour from 3:00 to 7:00 and it's 2:30 now.There's a hundred and forty-four inch diameter Elm tree out there just on the other side of the apartment building. It's probably 300 years old. I moved my neighbor's chairs and turned over her table because they could take out our windows. So if the top of the Elm goes down, it could take out the chimney. But I think it would just crash on the deck, probably make a nasty hole in neighbor's roof downstairs.Here's my lovely philodendron, that I love, on my bathtub and this gorgeous thing my son painted in second grade, and this is more artwork because when he was in elementary school second grade and he was always feeling my pain. Oh, my vanishing point fountain pen & my English dictionary from middle school and French-English dictionary, I need those in my bug out bag.I went to stock up on paper before everything shut down from CV-19. Oh my God. It's all loose." I set the laptop down and went into the kitchen, rambling about having been a Girl Scout, a very prepared Girl Scout and retrieve a plastic bag to protect the paper from moisture.

"I know people think I am crazy. But you know what? Liam and Tyler completely understand what I'm doing right now.

Survival, natural disasters...all the disasters they have survived. Oh, look at this! This awesome bag, this bag, it's from Raspberry Beret. Look at this." I puts a bunch of notebook paper and pencils into the red leather messenger bag.

"I tried to download, I mean I bought from freaking Google Fever Pitch because I wanted to watch it with my imaginary besties, Monogamous Mister Bond's Teddy and Jack but said there's a licensing error, what the hell a licensing error!? This is not the time, the first time I freaking download a film to watch. A video." I hold up a bright red liquid in a glass. "This is a Really good beverage, I'll show you the ingredients. All that, beautiful, really good products." As I scan the refrigerator. "So this is the artwork from Aya. It says 'I miss you this much.' Oh my God, here are her drawings of Cleo and here's my inspiration for my foi&GRÃCE series. Oh and the squeeze ball, from when I tried to donate blood at Mass General on Thursday. They couldn't find a vein.And there's all the sewing supplies, I borrowed a sewing machine from a neighbor. All right, 'Let's do, let's do it. We're okay. We're better than okay. We're, we're like we're Olympic! Olympic gold, like billion gold medalist, a good good, I don't know. This is another painting my son did, (I pans a large canvas with a Hawaiian flower, skull, calla lily.) Showing a Xerox on the refrigerator, 'Here's a really good galette recipe, so if I survive all this, I'm going to make a galette and I'll post it. Panning the wall of multiple small jars mounted with shoots of green, these are, this is my Nursery, all my little babies. Oh, I was going to show you so this is the beverage ingredients, Super tart 100% cranberry from Vermont and St. James rum from Martinique....because this is a moment. I need to congratulate myself on my preparedness. So that's it."

I walk into the bedroom, get into the bed, sitting up, propped on pillows. I show the camera, "Here are my grandmother's wedding rings and my japa ring and the Greek or Celtic swirl like waves ring my son gave me. And my Greek bracelets and one my son gave me." I grab at my necklace, "Here's my Cretian amulet, rose quartz and dog tag with 'All in' on it."

"Nice," they say in unison.

"You guys are doing that a lot lately like identical twins." They shrug their shoulders and Teddy says, "Whatevs" they dap each other then they suddenly sit up and go into Super elaborate bro, shake and then scramble out of bed to go into full body chest slams.

Jack does Thriller moves and a breakdance routine. Teddy looks on as I am cheering and clapping. "Yes, Jack, Go! Yes, go daddy! Go Jack go."

Teddy looks on and joins Catz supporting. You can't say your rooting your team to an Aussie because that means your having sex with them.

When Jack stops, breathing heavily from walking on his hands down the hallway and back.Teddy says, "Tayo you lost me at Thrilla."

"I'm heating up the tea, don't go away. Be right back."

"So hey, Teddy. Can you get Quibi for me? I can't do it, my 3G phone."

"What?" they chime in disbelief.

"Yep. Yep. Yep. Aya said 'Auntie Catz, why do you have such a small phone?' Oh, that's nothing. Hey, you guys ever see THE ultimate James Bond smoking hot chick phone? " I hold up one finger, run to my desk and runs back.

"Catch!" I say and they both lean forward like purebred Golden and black lab retrievers, end up shoulder checking each other, the phone bounces off one of them and I yell in slow motion. "Noooooooo" as it is arching through the air, destined to hit the floor. I dive a World Cup FIFA Champions League dive & just tips the phone so it redirects back toward the boys. Jack makes a World Series winning out fielding dive, catching it with his hands like a baseball glove, "Mine!!!" he hollered so loudly that Teddy & I recoiled back, out of the way, giving him space to make the catch.

I went back to the stove, the boys in bed with their phones each taking turns flipping the Jukebox open and closed, "My turn," Teddy elbows Jack in the chest. Smacks to grab the phone and then does his lip licking smile, catching himself from bro behavior, puts out his hand palm up. "Play Nice." I say peeking at them from the kitchen."Or you won't be allowed to train with us today."

Jack grins, places the Jukebox gently on Teddy's palm. He closes his fingers over it and a clamshell fashion. It disappears in his big paw. He rolls over on his left side to shield from Jack, definitely youngest of three boys behavior, with one elbow up in the air as enforcing shield and plays with it with his left hand somewhat clumsily.

Jack focuses on his phone, dials his Pops. "Hey checking in, all good. Yep." He glances at Teddy's back. "All good here. Have a Cressey Performance training today at something called a nor'easter. Okay. Love you. Miss you big hugs. Hugs. Stay healthy."

You know Tim Collins once said to me and a flashback, she's coming in the door across the performance dragon and two other baseball pictures or sitting in the entryway.

Cats walks in and tortoise Rim sunglasses and our custom order Express fake fur leopard coat Cass. You look like a movie star. She laughs and puts her stuff in a cubby and takes her Camp a handball shoes Sasquatch trained yet. She inquires the upper New York State Lefty baseball pitcher. She's hosting finishing up soon. Dragon says

A woman comes to walk through cats makes a caddy comment. Dragon says after she leaves that was really mean you should apologize cats blushes a little I can't she left my bad punish me. She laughs.

Does that mean I can't get my hug Bring It On he opens his wingspan up. You should take me to dinner. He says she laughs. No, I'll think of something she turns and walks into the gym.

Oh my God cats runs into the bedroom. They all thought I was hot and I didn't even notice. Oh my God, Dragon even came over when I was doing box steps and put his foot on the top and lean completely obviously into my personal space but didn't touch me and I just smiled and kept stepping he he was they may they both make quizzical look until their heads forward way.

Waiting for it.

Hitting on you. They finish her sentence as she Whispers hitting on me. Yeah says Teddy. Yeah says Jack in unison. Yes, thank shaking their head side to side a chuckling.

Oh my God, but I was Sleeping with the Enemy the bad boy Frenchy financial analyst who didn't give a shit shit rat's ass about me.

Flash bot flashback Sasquatches driving the blue Ford Mustang Mustang to handball practice cats. He's just trying to be nice. Nice house that being nice look. You can't go around wearing your heart on your sleeve spoken by the major Leaguer who's already Divorced with a kid on his way to spring training in Florida and three weeks and he is I don't know early 20s.

Was he Hot For Me?

Judging by your photo unless they were gay or married or maybe even then they were all hot for you. You are essentially Kate at the footie match just in a way more intimate because you were training with them. You got their testosterone going they all pumped hard when you were in the gym.

Oh my God, she turns back and walks contemplatively back into the back to the stove.

As the kettle whistles. Oh my God.

Whispering really quietly Jack turns to Liam. How could she be so clueless Liam shrugs and looks up and to the right.

Thinking Strokes his beard a few times. No one ever told her. She was really beautiful. I overheard her tell someone her sister was the pretty one that she was the athlete in the family.

Varsity cheerleader Jack says Bingo lingam Pope points to his phone flicking his wrist.

Set as a High School freshman. She was dating a senior at the Rival High School on the outskirts of Mad City. Where's that Mumu? Land Teddy flicks, then his phone moo moo land Teddy nods, Hawaii.

Jack says questioning

Liam imitates a cow and Cat sticks her head out to sea and Jack starts laughing with disbelief expressions.

You want steak for dinner instead of chicken tonight. Teddy cracks up. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Slip slop slap yippies.

Cass goes back to the kitchen Farmers to us is Wednesday 48 Hours Bucky Badger land Jack says she goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.

Jack asks and turns on his left side. What else spill quick?

She didn't have her first kiss until 17 and a half. Well guess she forgot the camp counselor kiss.

Jack winces and then looks angry like he'd be the shit out of the man if he ever knew him. I'm not a violent person Jack Whispers, but oh, I'd freaking kill him who knows he could be dead by now Jack nods. Do you know when you know Jack rolls on his right side and puts down his phone super quickly. He says it's complicated practically all the women in her family were unwed preggers.

slots back in the day

There were 13 Foster babies in our youngest sibling was aborted. She was a diaphragm baby and her pops a first-year med med student yelled at the mumsy's G gyne that he fit her wrong and the doc yells back. You didn't use it properly. You couldn't get birth control pills under age without parents permission. So,

Tyler looks at Guest. Oh my God beep beep fire fire. The alarm goes off. Fuck me cats yells from the bathroom.

Get the goddamn oatmeal.

from behind the door

Jack and Teddy jump out of bed and run to the door smelling the burning oats Teddy grabs the cat.

Opens the door and Sprint's down all flights of the stairs Jack goes to the stove and turns off the gas and calmly opens the oven door putting the pot in there as cats whips open the door Cool Wind and Rain Come gusting through the open window that has been in the background all morning.

Teddy is all clogged up by the cat.

Looking up from his boxers on the street.

Teddy's already outside in his boxers

Jack waves the dishcloth Fanning

the smoke from the alarm

Josh from the second floor opens his door.

You okay? It's my oatmeal. Sorry. I got distracted by him. Sorry, sorry.

I know we're all extremely anxious about fire. No worries. Glad you're safe says Josh and closes the door.

Teddy hears the alarm go off has the cat by the Scruff of her neck and pinned under his arm like a rugby football and bounces back up the stairs taking extreme deep stream lie deep breaths. Oh God guys, I am so so so so so sorry and she starts to cry. She is a flashback to the town alarm fire on Austin Street Barefoot bringing blankets and shoes and bread and chocolate and water and flip-flops to the stranded. Newly homeless Neighbors.

They all hug each other the tension such that they all start crying Callie Australia. They all three had pyro PTSD.

They had a deep hard Soul cleansing cry covid-19. The Nor'easter pushed them all over the cliff.

Teddy and Jack

and cats all had goosebumps from the gusts and then cat said oh God. Thank you Universe. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all our guardian angels all the gods and goddesses all the benevolent forces of the universe were safe were healthy or secure. Well, except for me leaving the gas stove unattended.

Her flash back to her calling Albert or 86 year old neighbor to go in through the back door and turn off the stove. She was in Cambridge and he was in Framingham.

About 45 minutes away when she had him for morning tea and homemade scones to thank him. He said didn't your mother ever tell you never to leave the stove unattended?

Teddy looks out the window, that's about

40 knots more than that, I'd say I'm checking the Weather Service. There must be an advisory. He goes to his phone.

Runs postponed at least until twenty hundred tosses it on the bed stay away from trees and windows they say cats and it's her brow and frowns buggers. It was going to be so much fun.

Flashback to her as six years old standing outside watching the sky with her grandmother in Kansas as the tornado sirens are blowing and relatives or yelling at them from the storm cellar to come inside.

That morning. She woke at 8:15 a.m. To Cleo pawing the covers. She fed her and went back to sleep in just her just her underwear.

And when she woke up, she started to talk to open up. She'd been fantasizing about her Teddy who lives for weeks now, they made love already. He was already at the top of the list holding number one.

Her Zenith Mount Everest. Hi difference.

She rolled over and lay her head on his chest put her thigh over his stiffy and then tickled his obliques softly with her fingernails. Just barely touching his skin. He shivered and said how bad of huh buddy do what she interpreted as more please she licked her lips and softly nibbled his nipple just under her cheek and lickety-split. Her knickers were off and her eyes were sparkling Tinkerbell Sparkles. Her loins were hot her.

Began to race and she hummed then purred and then said your wish is my command. Misdemeanor Monsieur Bond qu'est-ce que tu veux

Oo-la-la his tongue garbled. She laughed. She thought he would know this by now.

What is it that you want I will give you everything 110% Olympic lovemaking. I've been practicing while you've been.

Ankle biter making with Gabriella. He coughed choking laughing and made a timeout sign he sat up and turned to face her straight on you. What don't be upset. It's not like you're cheating or anything. I mean, she doesn't know me and you don't know me and I don't really know you accept. Well, I've seen enough interviews to feel like I know you I mean we were together like a zillion previous lifetimes.

She's nervous and doesn't want to freak him out. I shouldn't have told you that. Oh shit. Did I crack your shits? Oh, please please please. Don't be crook. Oh, you're all crickey here here. Let me make it let me kiss it and make it all better her expression. His expression is baffled bewildered curious comical shocked. Fuck me dead.

She looks quizzical and makes time outside and says stay right there. Don't move don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. She jumps out of bed and runs to her desk and takes out an Aussie English dictionary.

She's you here. Mad page-turning. Fuck me dead that surprises me. Oh God, that's a relief. You hear the drawer closed and she Sprint's back to bed and jumps in she'll be apples. She grins. He laughs rolls his eyes and looks up to the ceiling runs his hand over his forehead then beard then trying not to crack up.

Can I make it Ripper raft she grabs for his unit. Now, he can't help but crack up and he blocks her with I want to stoke you. She squeals and goes to tickle him hard and he rolls back and they wrestle in bed. I want to be your bloody Fair Dinkum into poolroom Sheila. He laughs harder and they wrestle more he has her wrist, but she's quick and wiggles around a straddle him and she's on top and heaving with all her might to force him back down. I want to

slip slap slop

she chants the not happy Jam. No Gary. No now he's holding his sides and he's crying. He's laughing so hard. Oh my god. What have you been watching? Call 13 303 to she sings 30 40 42

sing Banana Boat Frog song singing in the Frog voice. No, no, no, no. No, ahh, then she stops and says that dearie and get still and serious and takes a deep breath. He stops laughing and then she grabs his hands 1/3 oo6 triple 506 and makes them cheer side to side.

And his jaw drops. What's the Sultana? He grabs her and kisses her full Lon and she squeals she says giggling. Can we have chicken tonight tomorrow because today's Easter so we should have Greek Easter lamb kebabs Rhonda. Yes, Rhonda.

Her phone Chimes its time. They both turn and then look back at each other in unison. It's time it's time you for a quickie. She says moving down his torso. That's my reminder. Why Zoom peer support call. Alrighty, then is Father's day and Easter as she turned around to deliver the goods.

She mentioned a lot about online dating disasters and asked the two men about their experiences and for help. I guess I need a dating coach. She blurted out. I just don't get it. Why do they say they liked my profile my profile, but we're not a match. I mean if you like my profile wouldn't that mean that you would like me? I am me I wrote my profile.

Well, a lot of people don't have real things in their profiles a lot is made up or fake or outright lies.

I have three deal-breakers.

My beard my tackiness and I forgot the third I may have lowered the age to see if that helps.

One of her peer support members contributed I suppose that makes sense like come up with my top three to five must-haves and then just be ruthless, but I'm sick of the Grandpa's emailing me. I don't want to date my dad. Everyone left. Maybe I just need to give it more of a chance. It's God's will another responded. You mean maybe it's not going to happen this lifetime and everyone laughed God willing she mumbles.

Maybe I'll just keep watching the dressmaker and can you keep a secret over and over everyone laughed again?

American men are just so primitive compared to European Middle Eastern Greek men. They dress well, they're polite the respectful. They really love the women in their lives. Another woman piped in hmm concur. Boston is so provincial and everyone's in such a hurry and no one seems to look around and enjoy a passing attractive person.

Well, all that's changing now.

Hmm. Yeah suppose it would be nice to get to know someone through writing and phone calls being long distance even across the street you'd find out who's true blue.

After the call, she felt rejuvenated connected cared for listen to and she came to a new revelation. She did want to date someone her very own. Monogamous James Bond. Not just Teddy and Jack she watched some YouTube and came across Nathaniel Drew interviewing his polyglot Grandma Arabic French Italian Hebrew Spanish Greek and English. They effortlessly went in and out of these languages he

Understand Hebrew or Arabic the subtitles were lovely. She laughed delighted that she knew the Greek most French some Arabic some Italian some Spanish and of course English.

She subscribe to his Channel watch more videos and was Cliffhanger watching his stranded in Paris Alone video. She had flashbacks to her time in Paris during the terrorist bombings in September 1986. A waiter had said to her and her mother that they were Brave Americans stupid Americans foolish ignorant to women without protective man. She was mortified mortified when her mother decided the thing to do was to go to the American Embassy and ask them what

Should do after the extensive Security check and many men carrying AK-47s and bomb proof vest and everything. They finally reached the inner sanctum and approached a marine likely just one or two years older or maybe even her same age. He said lady you have an American passport if you don't like it here go home.

Four thousand shades of red flushed as she slid down to the floor and backed out onto the streets of Paris.

This wasn't terrorism or War as Monsieur Drew mentioned their solidarity were all equally into this together. No one is Invincible the images of the people clapping and they're balconies at 8 p.m. Every night. Maybe I will just go out at 8 p.m. Every night and chai my Tibetan bells for three rings and say some prayers she'd learned that Mother Teresa was Albanian and that she'd gone to Rome for her religious instruction and the dictator close the border so she couldn't return home.

And so went on her mission to Calcutta.

She briefly seen that u.s. Now has more deaths than any other country were being taken to task for not having adequate leadership disaster bio disaster management the CDC and health officials. No one wanted to step up and say Evacuate the University's what fucking chicken shits no fucking balls in the face of a pandemic that swept across the globe. Nobody in a position of power wanted to take responsibility.

She went to Instagram to see Nathaniel Drew Instagram and there.

Was Liam in bed black and white photo? So she instant messaged him happily. Happy baby making she hit the bolster. I just fucking Instagram messaged you connected were all connected. We are freely commit communicating. She lay between the two of them Teddy and Jack and said look you each have your babes. I want my version of you.

Oh my God, I have never imagined being in a threesome ever and here you two are an oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, you are both here and is just me with my legs up in the air imagining. Oh my God.

With rum refilled her life stream water bottle and returned at the doorway nipples Iraq through her sheer brassiere. She announced I need you boys to filter out the douchebags sift through all the riffraff for the gold my monogamous Mr. Bond, they both laughed and look at each other and said how hard can that be? Sure. No probs. We got this. She shook her head thinking

In can you keep a secret sipping her bundini? She reactivated her match account and responded to a few not thrilled. But whatever. She's in the game. That's what matters.

Yeah, there are some stalkers and sociopaths and shit, but I'm just here in my little TBI life doing my little self publishing happy dancing remote training roof deck planting thing. Fuck.

You don't have a bodyguard in unison. What the fuck boys I live a normal non Ela a non Melbourne Sydney Outback, whatever life. Oh, they say together and shrug their shoulders. What am I going to do? Stay home and social distancing. They both say together wash your hands for 20 seconds often they chime in.

No, no Tim Ferris says if you have ever ordered anything to your address, you're fucked. I'm fucked. I ordered furnace filters and flea meds and vitamins from CVS and resistance bands and champagne. Remember we celebrated my self publishing. Wow.
